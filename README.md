# HeartDisease-prediction
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical and physical features. The model will use machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease (a binary classification task) using patient data, including vital statistics and health indicators.

Approach
The project involves several key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
Before building the model, the data needs to be prepared.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is used to visualize patterns and relationships in the dataset. Visualizing data helps to understand feature distributions, correlations, and detect any anomalies.

3. Feature Selection and Engineering
After EDA, we identify which features are most important in predicting heart disease:

    a. Correlation Analysis: Helps determine if any features should be removed due to multicollinearity (i.e., features that are highly correlated).
   
    b. Domain Knowledge: Medical knowledge helps ensure that significant features such as age, sex, and max heart rate are retained, even if they don't have high statistical significance.

5. Model Building
With clean and prepared data, we can now build the prediction model.

6. Model Evaluation
Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recal(sensitivity), f1 score, etc.

7. Threshold Setting
Once performance metrics are computed, thresholds must be set to decide whether the model is good enough for deployment.
